# Data Analysis Using Python - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview
This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset using Python. EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process, helping to summarize the main characteristics of the data, uncover patterns, and identify relationships. The project uses key Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation, visualization, and insight generation.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dataanalysis_Using_Python_EDA.git
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook file `Dataanalysis_Using_Python_EDA.ipynb`.

---

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Handle missing data by either dropping missing entries or filling them with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median, mode).
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure that data is in the correct format and remove any unnecessary or duplicate records.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if required, based on the data available to extract more meaningful insights.

---

### Visualization
Various visualizations are used to gain insights into the dataset:
- **Histograms**: Understand the distribution of numerical variables.
- **Bar Plots**: Visualize categorical data and compare categories.
- **Scatter Plots**: Explore relationships between two variables.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identify correlations between numerical variables.
  
Example code snippet:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Correlation Heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

---

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static and interactive plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment to run Python code with embedded visualizations.
